1. Want to be able to run all steps for just a specific region of the ref corresponding to an annotated feature
2. Handle rev complement features
3. Handle rev complement reads
4. Do we want to handle full codon deletions?
5. What is expected behaviour if have overlapping features and different edits found in each?
6. Update merge to not require user interaction, but iterative running until a condition satisfied



MERGE:
 - take tmp.all.edits as input
 - remove tmp file when all queries addressed
 - update docstrings for functions
 - update tests
 - update functions so no default parameters - defaults all specified on command line?
