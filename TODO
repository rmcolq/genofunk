1. Allow joins in genbank coordinates e.g. ORF1ab - this would require getting the sequence to repeat a base when
writing the final alignment and perhaps to insert a couple of Ns to get frames correct when just looking for pairwise
alignments
 - apply edit finding etc independently for parts of a join
 - at end when checking if start with M and end with *, consider joined up seq
2. Get from finding ORF coordinates to concat amino acid alignments (no edits discovered)
3. Include a check for stop codons - should have one at the end and none in the middle
4. Create run routine which compares existing fasta to a new fasta and runs annotate/updates annotations for only
sequences which have been added or updated
5. Then start to discover required edits

6. Passing an editfile into annotate.py will cause an error because consensus sequences can't be edited in place now

1. Want to be able to run all steps for just a specific region of the ref corresponding to an annotated feature
2. Handle rev complement features
3. Handle rev complement reads
4. Do we want to handle full codon deletions?
5. What is expected behaviour if have overlapping features and different edits found in each?
